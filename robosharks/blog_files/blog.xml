If your team received 15-tooth pinions and needs the 19-tooth pinions, please contact FIRST to trade motors at <a href="mailto:frcparts@usfirst.org" rel="self">frcparts@usfirst.org</a>.

We have accomplished everything that was on our list for this week. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough we also sent off all of our frame material to go get welded. Things are really looking good as we head into the last week of the build season.<br /><br />Today the Robo-Sharks participated in an amazing fundraiser event at our school called Shark-Aid. This event was to raise money and collect non perishable food items to help in the aid of Haiti. Who knew that smashing a pie in someone&rsquo;s face could be so entertaining.<br /><br />~The Robo-Sharks 1612]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Week 4</title><dc:creator>RoboSharks1612@gmail.com</dc:creator><category>FRC</category><category>Meetings</category><dc:date>2010-02-06T19:24:57-05:00</dc:date><link>http://therobosharks.com/blog.php#unique-entry-id-14</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://therobosharks.com/blog.php#unique-entry-id-14</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[So we have reached the end of the fourth week.

It was exciting to see how talented everyone is at driving this year. Here is a quick look at our system for this year, it may look a bit messy at first but it is quite organized if you take a second look.<br /><a href="" rel="self"><img class="imageStyle" alt="IMG_0070" src="http://therobosharks.com/blog_files/img_0070.jpg" width="480" height="360"/></a><br /><br />~The Robo-Sharks 1612]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Week 2</title><dc:creator>RoboSharks1612@gmail.com</dc:creator><category>FRC</category><category>Meetings</category><dc:date>2010-01-23T20:09:14-05:00</dc:date><link>http://therobosharks.com/blog.php#unique-entry-id-12</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://therobosharks.com/blog.php#unique-entry-id-12</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week was very exciting we have finish a few major tasks and the outcome is stunning. We have finished our drive system that we have created. We have developed axel block for our wheels that use gravity to adjust the tension of our chains. While they also tension our chains they also act as a type of suspension system for our robot. These amazing wheel mounts are a miracle and really amazing to see in action. If you are attending the florida regional be sure to stop by our pit and someone will be more then happy to show them to you. We are very proud of our innovative creations that do 2 jobs in one.<br /><br />~The Robo-Sharks 1612]]></content:encoded></item></channel>
